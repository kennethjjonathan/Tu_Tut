# Tu_Tut
Don't be confused by the name, Tu Tut! is a simple, top-down 2D, airplane shooting game. And as you could tell, picking a name is not my strongest suit.

For Tu Tut!, I made an object pool for the bullets to improve the game performance.

Tu Tut! is the first game I ever made. Coming from a non-technical background, I was experiencing a lot of things for the first time, such as coding, using Unity, and using GitHub. I also discover my interest in coding and exploring it further.

I want to thank Kevin Sutrisno for sparing his time every week to share his experience, check my game, and be a pleasant person to talk to. Kevin is a professional game developer with something exciting coming up! (you can check some of his work here: [ksutrisno.github.io](ksutrisno.github.io)).

I also want to credit Goldmetal for providing the free beautiful sprites I use for Tu Tut! in Unity Asset Store.

A few things for trying Tu Tut!:
1. Use WASD keys or arrow keys to move.
2. Make it full-screen so the game doesn't get cropped.
3. The "Quit" button won't work since I didn't make the game with the WebGL build in mind. To quit the game, press "Esc" to exit the full-screen and close the tab.

Thank you for checking Tu Tut! and my GitHub. I am still getting the hang of using GitHub, so I probably made mistakes here and there.
